# RGB Colour Guessing Game
**An RGB colour guessing game built as part of The Web Developer Bootcamp course**

> https://svisscher.github.io/wdb-colour-game/

This game was built to practice newly acquired skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. At the same time it served as a sandbox project to learn more about how to structure and refactor code, linting and style guides in VSCode, and working with git.

## Rules
The rules are simple: select the colour that corresponds to the RGB value displayed! Choose correctly and you win (yes!). Choose the wrong colour and you may try again until you run out of squares to click (boo, are you even trying?).

Switch between Easy and Hard game mode, depending on the level of challenge you are looking for. In Easy mode, there are three colours to choose from, while in Hard mode there are six.

Reset the game with new colours by clicking on 'New colours' while still playing or 'Play again?' after you have guessed the correct colour.
